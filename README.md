# LiveBinders Library

[Read Doc](kdoc/library/index.md)

*This library is currently in development*

The goal of this library is to provide `@BindingAdapter` methods, and extension methods, in order to allow setting:

* `MutableLiveData` to views, for example, being able to set a `MutableLiveData<String>()` as text of a `TextView`
* Variable to views directly in layout with DataBinding, for example: `<View app:clickListener="@{viewModel.clickListener}" />`
